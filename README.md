KodeKloud DevOps 100 Day challenge every task every day


Instead of passive lectures, I’ll tackle one practical DevOps task per day—just like on the job

The challenge guides you through key areas including:

Linux scripting ,system navigation and troubleshooting

Git workflows (branching, rebasing, team practices)

Docker containerization

Kubernetes deployment and troubleshooting

Jenkins pipelines and CI/CD pipelines

Infrastructure automation using Ansible

Infrastructure as Code with Terraform (across AWS/GCP/Azure)
