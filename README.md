# DevOps 100-Day Challenge

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **KodeKloud DevOps 100-Day Challenge**. The challenge focuses on **hands-on practical tasks every day**, simulating real-world DevOps scenarios.

## About the Challenge

Instead of passive lectures, the challenge encourages tackling **one practical DevOps task per day**, just like on the job. By the end of 100 days, you will have built a strong foundation in multiple DevOps tools and practices.

- **Linux**: Scripting, system navigation, and troubleshooting  
- **Git**: Workflows including branching, rebasing, and team practices  
- **Docker**: Containerization and management  
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment, scaling, and troubleshooting  
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipelines and automation
